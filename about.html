I'm cyliim and I program. For over a year now, I've been interested in, and doing, programming. <br>My interest was sparked back in 2015, when I was introduced to HTML by one of my friends, and was hooked. Ever since then, I was making small webpage projects, and eventually moved on to Scratch. Then I discovered Discord. I was fascinated by all of the bots I saw, how they worked, and everything else about them. I decided I wanted to make my own. This, over the course of months, got me to where I am today.</p>
